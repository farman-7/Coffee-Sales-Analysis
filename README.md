Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to identify patterns and trends in their sales data. This project aims to answer the following:

Which months had the highest and lowest sales?
Do sales differ between weekdays and weekends?
Which store locations and products are top performers?
How can visual analytics provide actionable insights?
Steps in SQL
Data Walkthrough
Data Preparation: Organize raw data files.
Database Creation: Create a structured database.
Data Cleaning: Fix errors, handle null values, and adjust data types.
SQL Queries:
Analyzed sales, orders, and quantities month-on-month.
Used window functions for comparative metrics.
Aggregated data to support visualizations.
ðŸ‘‰ Example SQL Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT  
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS Month,  
    SUM(sales) AS Total_Sales,  
    LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m')) AS Previous_Month_Sales,  
    (SUM(sales) - LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m'))) AS Sales_Difference  
FROM sales_data  
GROUP BY Month;
