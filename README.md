## Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to identify patterns and trends in their sales data. This project aims to answer the following:  

- Which months had the highest and lowest sales?  
- Do sales differ between weekdays and weekends?  
- Which store locations and products are top performers?  
- How can visual analytics provide actionable insights?

## Steps in SQL

### Data Walkthrough
1. **Data Preparation**: Organize raw data files.  
2. **Database Creation**: Create a structured database.  
3. **Data Cleaning**: Fix errors, handle null values, and adjust data types.  
4. **SQL Queries**:  
   - Analyzed sales, orders, and quantities month-on-month.  
   - Used window functions for comparative metrics.  
   - Aggregated data to support visualizations.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Example SQL Query**:

```sql
SELECT  
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS Month,  
    SUM(sales) AS Total_Sales,  
    LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m')) AS Previous_Month_Sales,  
    (SUM(sales) - LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m'))) AS Sales_Difference  
FROM sales_data  
GROUP BY Month;



## SQL Functionalities Used

Here are the key SQL techniques applied:

| **Category**         | **Functions**                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Date Functions**    | `STR_TO_DATE`, `DAY`, `MONTH`, `HOUR`, `DAYOFWEEK` |
| **Aggregations**      | `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`         |
| **Conditionals**      | `CASE`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`     |
| **Table Modifications** | `ALTER TABLE`, `UPDATE TABLE`, `CHANGE COLUMN` |
| **Window Functions**  | `LAG`, `ROW_NUMBER`                        |
| **Joins & Queries**   | `JOINS`, `SUBQUERIES`, `LIMIT`, `ALIAS`     |

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Here are the actionable insights generated:

1. **Total Sales Analysis**: Monthly sales trends and MoM growth rates.  
2. **Total Orders Analysis**: Order volumes and differences across months.  
3. **Quantity Sold Analysis**: Quantity trends and highlights.  

**ðŸ‘‰ Insight Example**:  
*"Sales peaked in December, with a 15% increase from November. Weekday sales outperformed weekends by 20%."*
